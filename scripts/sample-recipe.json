  "shortDescription": "Crispy chicken and tender broccoli coated in a sweet and savory honey sesame sauce, ready in 30 minutes.",

  "story": "This honey sesame chicken and broccoli became my go-to weeknight dinner when I got tired of ordering takeout but still craved those sweet, savory Chinese flavors. The light coating on the chicken creates this perfect crispy exterior that holds onto the glossy honey sesame sauce beautifully, while the tender-crisp broccoli adds that fresh contrast you need. What I love most is how the whole thing comes together in about 30 minutes, making it faster than delivery but so much better tasting. My kids actually eat the broccoli without complaining when it's coated in this incredible sauce.",
  "testimonial": "The first time I made this, my husband took one bite and asked if I'd secretly ordered Chinese food because it tasted so authentic. When he realized I'd made it myself, he immediately requested it for the following week's meal plan. My daughter, who normally picks out every piece of broccoli from any dish, actually asked for extra vegetables because she loved how they tasted with the sauce.",

  "mustKnowTips": [
    "**Don't overcook the broccoli** - Tender-crisp is perfect since it gets warmed through again with the sauce",
    "**Let chicken brown undisturbed** - Moving it too early prevents proper browning and crispy coating",
    "**Whisk sauce thoroughly** - Lumpy cornstarch creates an unappetizing texture in the final dish"

  "professionalSecrets": [
    "**Room temperature chicken** - Let it sit out for 15 minutes before cooking for more even cooking",
    "**Don't crowd the pan** - Cook in batches if necessary to maintain proper browning",
    "**Taste and adjust** - Add more honey for sweetness or soy sauce for saltiness to suit your preferences"
